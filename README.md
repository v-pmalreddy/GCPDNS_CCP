## Introduction
The Google Cloud Platform DNS Codeless Connector for Microsoft Sentinel enables seamless integration of Google Cloud Platform's DNS logs with Microsoft Sentinel without the need for custom code. Developed as part of the Codeless Conector Platform(CCP), this connector simplifies the process of collecting and ingesting DNS query logs and DNS audit logs from Google Cloud Platform into Sentinel.
# Steps to Connect

<a name="step1">
   
## Step - 1 Install the connector
- Install the **Google Cloud Platform DNS** connector from `Content Hub`

<a name="step2">

## Step - 2 Adding the new Collector
- After installing the connector, navigate to `Data Connectors` and select on the **Google Cloud Platform DNS** Connector.

- A new window pops up in the bottom, and click on `Open Connector Page`. 

- Now, click on `Add new collector` button.

## Step - 3 Fill the required details
Navigate to Google Cloud Console and select the project you want to monitor and fetch the following fields

- `Project ID` and `Project Number` : You can find these details in the home page of the project.

- `GCP subscription name` : If the subscription already exists, search for **Pub/Sub** section in the search bar and navigate to the subscription tab. You can find the details about subscrition name and subscription state.
- If the subscription does not exist, go to the **Topics** section and create a new topic with the desired topic ID.
- After the topic is created, proceed to the **Subscriptions** section and create a new subscription  with the desired subscription ID by selecting the specific topic ID.
- Provide the appropriate details for the below mentioned fields based on your requirement:
  - Delivery Type
  - Message retention duration
  - Expiration period
  - Acknowledgement deadline
  - Subscription filter
  - Exactly once delivery
  - Message ordering
  - Dead lettering
  - Retry policy


- `Workload identity pool ID` and `Workload identity provider ID` : To get this ID, you must run the terraform script for DNS in cloud shell of Google Cloud Platform. You can find the script files in the home page of the connector or find them in the steps provided below.

### Steps to execute Terrraform scripts
[Click here](https://github.com/v-pmalreddy/GCPDNS_CCP/tree/main/GCPDNSLogsSetup) to access the terraform scripts.
- Launch the cloud shell and create a directory using **mkdir <dir_name>** and navigate to the directory using **cd<dir_name>**.
- Copy the raw link of the Terraform script and get the content of the file into a shell using the following command:
   ```
   wget <link of the file> -O <filename.tf>
   ```
- Now run the following commands

   Initializes your terraform working directory, downloads provider plugins, and configures the backend for state storage.
   ```
   terraform init
   ```
   Creates an execution plan to show what actions terraform will take to achieve the desired state of your infrastructure.
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```
   Executes the actions proposed in the Terraform plan to create, update, or destroy resources in your infrastructure.
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```
- After successfully executing the above mentioned commands, the workload Identity Pool ID and Provider ID is created.
- Search for **Workload Identity Federation** in the search bar and find the Workload Identity pool ID and Provider ID.
- `Service account email` : Navigate to **Service accounts** section from the search bar and use the appropriate service account for authentication.

After filling all the details accurately click on `Connect`, then you will be able to connect the Google Cloud Platform DNS connector to monitor DNS logs.
